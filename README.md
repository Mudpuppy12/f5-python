# f5-python
============

F5-python adds a rest api and tmsh parser for managing F5 bigip load balancers. It was written
to parse the output of the ansible-openstack f5-config.py program.

f5-5-5.py
=========
The f5-5-5.py program is a branch of the f5-config.py script for the 10.x RPC release. It will take
a rpc inventory json file and output tmsh commands that a tech can cut and paste into the shell.


f5_tmsh.py
==========
This program takes the output of the above program tmsh output, parses the commands and makes the rest calls
to configure the F5 device. It will use paramiko to upload ssl keys and certificates as well as external monitors
to the device.

usage: f5_tmsh.py

Parsing tmsh
=============

Some considerations are needed when parsing the tmsh. { must be spaced around keywords.
Example below

BAD
create ltm snatpool /RPC/RPC_SNATPOOL {members replace-all-with {172.29.236.15}}

GOOD
create ltm snatpool /RPC/RPC_SNATPOOL { members replace-all-with { 172.29.236.15 } }

The parser also expects to see a format like below:

token /Partiton/Name { commands }

BUGS
====

Yes it has, this is an alpha version. It has not been tested extensively. It should work with all previous versions
of f5-config.py
